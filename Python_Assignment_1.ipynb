    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Inheritance is a powerful feature in object oriented programming. The main purpose of inheritance is the reusability of code because we can use the existing class to create a new class instead of creating it from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "It refers to defining a new class with little or no modification to an existing class. The new class is called derived (or child) class and the one from which it inherits is called the base (or parent) class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In inheritance, the derived class acquires and access all the data members, properties, and functions from the base class. Also, a derived class can also provide its specific implementation to the methods of the base class.\n",
